> [!NOTE] 
> Doesn't include cost of 3D printing, tools, shippings and taxes.

| Price| US  | EU  | CN |
|---------|----:|----:|----:|
| **Build from Scratch** |  **~$660**  |  **~€650**  |  **~¥3900**  |
| **Upgrade from 2 SO100 arms**  |  **~$400**  |  **~€440**  |  **~¥2400**  |
| **Upgrade from 1 Lekiwi** |  **~$370**  |  **~€350**  |  **~¥1900**  |
| **Upgrade from 1 Lekiwi and 1 SO100 arm** |  **~$250**  |  **~€240**  |  **~¥1200**  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We want **XLeRobot** to be **powerful**, so there's only a single 12V version. If you are using your pre-assembled SO100 and Lekiwi, their motors also need to be the 12V version. While the 7.4V version might also work normally, it is not recommended as it has not been tested and cannot achieve optimal performance.

- The flush cutter is for cutting the metal mesh for cable routing.
- This tool list serves as a reference—feel free to use any tools that will get the job (mainly screwing hex and cross-head screws) done.



## ⏫ Extra Parts for XLeRobot ⏫

If you already have 2 SO100 Arms and 1 Lekiwi base, you'll only need these additional parts 

(but also check the _Build From Scratch_ section below since the list is not 100% the same)

- I couldn't find any ready-made long 5264 wires for purchase in US—**only connector kits** that require manual assembly to extend the length (easy to do though).
- You can definitely choose **similar cheaper cart not from IKEA**, in this case [slight change]() to the 3D printed part might be needed.
- While this battery🔋 may seem expensive💵, its functionality and reliability far exceed regular power banks. (Like in electric vehicles🚗, its battery is also one of the most expensive components.)
- You can also choose **other batteries**, just make sure the maximum output is large enough to power 2 arms, 3 wheels, and a RasberryPi.
- 2 Type C to DC wires(12V) connect motor control board to the power supply.



## 🌿 Build From Scratch 🌿

For those starting from scratch (without SO100 arms or Lekiwi), besides the parts from _Extra Parts for XeLeRobot_, you also need to build the arms and Lekiwi base first.

> [!NOTE]
> The parts list for 2x SO100 arms and 1 Lekiwi base in this repo contains fewer components than the original bills (mainly cable and battery-related items). If you're building **XLeRobot** from scratch, you can use this repo's bill directly. However, it's recommended to check the other two repos ([SO100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/tree/main), [Lekiwi](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/LeKiwi/blob/main/BOM.md)) as well, in case there are updated options at better prices.

> [!NOTE] 
> Both of the 2 SO100 Arms are follower arms in hardware setup, you can use one of them as the leader arm for testing teleop without the need to remove the gears of the motors (instructed in the original SO100 tutorial) if you want to save money with only 2 arms.

- You can use/buy whatever brand of cables (USB-C cable should be fast-charging type), microSD card, Raspberry Pi 5
- 2 USB-C to USB-A Cables connect the Motor Control Board to Rasberry Pi/PC
- USB-C Cable connects Rasberry Pi to the battery

These components will allow you to replicate Demo 0.0.5, enabling master-slave arm control and direct PC control of both arms.
